## Introduction
[CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/) is an online game where you compete to write the shortest possible CSS code to replicate given target designs - It's a fun way to improve your CSS skills

Here I provide my solutions to various CSS Battle challenges

**_*Important*_**: I do not focus on as few characters as possible but rather on a high match score and readability

Please note that I currently do not have premium access to CSS Battle, which limits my ability to complete all the [daily targets](./Daily%20Targets/). However, I regularly update this repository with the challenges I can access

Feel free to explore, learn, and improve your own CSS skills by checking out my solutions :D !
